# Random Forest Regression

Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. It extends the Random Forest algorithm to regression tasks by averaging the predictions of individual trees.

## How It Works

- Multiple decision trees are trained on bootstrapped samples of the data.
- Each tree predicts a continuous target value.
- The final prediction is the average of all trees' predictions.
- Random selection of features at splits ensures decorrelated trees.

## When to Use

- For regression problems with complex, non-linear relationships.
- When you want robust predictions less prone to overfitting.
- Effective on high-dimensional or mixed data types.

## Implementation in Python

Below is an example of Random Forest Regression on a sample dataset using scikit-learn.

## Summary

Random Forest Regression combines the strengths of multiple decision trees to provide robust and accurate regression predictions for complex datasets.
