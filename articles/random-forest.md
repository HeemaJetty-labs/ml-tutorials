# Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. It works by creating many decision trees from random subsets of the training data and features, then aggregating their results through majority voting for classification tasks.

## How It Works

- Random subsets of the training data are drawn with replacement (bootstrap samples).
- Each decision tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample.
- At each split in the tree, a random subset of features is considered.
- The final prediction is determined by majority vote across all trees (classification) or averaging (regression).

## When to Use

- Suitable for both classification and regression tasks.
- Works well on structured/tabular data.
- Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
- Robust to noisy data and less prone to overfitting than single decision trees.

## Implementation in Python

The example below demonstrates a Random Forest classifier using scikit-learn on the Iris dataset.

## Summary

Random Forest leverages the power of multiple decision trees and randomness to deliver highly accurate and robust classification models. It is widely used due to its ease of use and strong performance on many datasets.
