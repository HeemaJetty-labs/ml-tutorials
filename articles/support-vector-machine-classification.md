# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane which best separates different classes in the feature space by maximizing the margin between them.

## How It Works

- Constructs a decision boundary (hyperplane) to separate classes.
- Supports linear and non-linear classification using kernel tricks (linear, polynomial, RBF).
- Uses support vectors (critical data points) for defining the boundary.
- Regularization parameter `C` controls the trade-off between margin size and classification error.

## When to Use

- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- When clear margin of separation exists.
- Useful for binary and multi-class classification.

## Summary

Support Vector Machine classification uses the concept of optimal hyperplanes to separate classes with maximum margin in high-dimensional feature spaces. It offers strong performance on both linear and non-linear classification tasks, especially when using appropriate kernels and hyperparameter tuning.
