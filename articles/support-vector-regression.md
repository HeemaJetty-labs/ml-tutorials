# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) applies the principles of Support Vector Machines to regression problems. It tries to fit a function within a margin of tolerance (epsilon), focusing on support vectors and ignoring errors within the margin.

## How It Works

- Fits a regression function with a margin of tolerance `epsilon`.
- Uses kernels to capture linear and non-linear relationships.
- Regularization parameter `C` controls the trade-off between model complexity and tolerance to errors.

## When to Use

- Regression tasks with small or moderate datasets.
- Models requiring flexibility and robustness to noise.
- Non-linear regression problems.

## Implementation in Python

## Summary

Support Vector Regression extends the concepts of SVM to predict continuous variables, efficiently handling noisy and non-linear regression problems with the help of kernels. Proper tuning of parameters like `C` and `epsilon` significantly influences model performance and generalization.
